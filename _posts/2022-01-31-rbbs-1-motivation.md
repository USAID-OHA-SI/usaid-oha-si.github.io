Part 1 of the coRps R Building Blocks Series (RBBS). All content can be found on this blog under the `rbbs` category as well as on the [USAID-OHA-SI/coRps GitHub repo](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/coRps).

## RBBS 1 - Motivation

We want to kick this series off by providing some motivation for why we are prompting coding via R and how we are doing it in this office. We will also spend time to troubleshoot setting up the required tools and accounts.

### Learning Objectives
  - Benefits of learning to code
  - Framework for the approach and direction
  - How we are currently leveraging R
  - Where to accessing resources
