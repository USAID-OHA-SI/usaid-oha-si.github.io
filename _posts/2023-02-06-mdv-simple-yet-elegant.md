I wanted to share a graphic I lifted from [Philip Bump’s newsletter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/how-to-read-this-chart/). In it, he shows a [simple yet elegant plot](https://twitter.com/JayCuda/status/1615921344054525954) from Jay Cuda, which depicts baseball stadium elevations. The outlier at the very tippy top is the Colorado Rockies’ Coors Field in Denver. So, it doesn’t take a super fancy graph to make a strong point (or to point out a very strong outlier).

Happy plotting!
