 I've long rebuked the use of dual axes plots and last week, I saw yet [another great example of why multi-axes can be so dangerous](https://twitter.com/koen_vde/status/1532675217260269568?s=27&t=xCs8r-KQQjzxnaSXHugMMA). The example comes to use from Koen Van den Eeckhout. He pulled the visual below, which has some truncated and manipulated axes to make it appear there is a strong correlation between sugar intake and obesity.

 Van den Eeckhout takes the time to design two remakes to better represent the trends. I think the second does a pretty good job comparing the growth (indexed from the 1980s level).

Happy plotting!
