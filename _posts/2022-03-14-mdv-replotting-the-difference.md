It's been a little while since Andy Kirk updated his ["Little of Visualization Design" series"](https://www.visualisingdata.com/2016/03/little-visualisation-design/), but he [added a new post last week](https://www.visualisingdata.com/2022/03/the-little-of-visualisation-design-part-73/), which sparked some joy in me.  Kirk highlights the below visual from [Timour Scrève](https://chezvoila.com/member/timour-screve/) at Voila, which compares the wage gap (gray area) between men and women.

The key element here is the secondary plotting of the wage gap along the x-axis. Kirk says 

> For a reader, it can be difficult to perceive the absolute size of this gap given the baseline (in this case, the yellow line for 'women') shifts up and down. I think it is really smart, therefore, to embed a secondary plot within the same chart space using an area chart at the bottom of the chart to show the trends of wage-gap itself.

I think this is brilliant as well, further benefited by Scrève's use of color, title labeling, and annotation. 

Happy plotting!
