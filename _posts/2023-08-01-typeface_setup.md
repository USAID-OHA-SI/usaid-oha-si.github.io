## Source Sans Pro Typeface

#### Installing Source Sans Pro

To create standard visualizations across our SI team, we rely on one of USAID's alternate fonts, [Sans Source Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro). This typeface is not only not native to R, nor is it a standard to Windows, but is an open source typeface available from Google Fonts.

To install the font on your GFE, you can find it in Software Center (Start \> Microsoft Endpoint manager \> Software Center). Once there, you can select the Application called "Source Sans Pro" and click "Install".

To install it on your computer, navigate to the typeface on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and click the "Download family". After the folder finishes downloading, unzip it.

#### Accessing Fonts in R

To use non-native fonts in R, you must run a program called `extrafonts`. You will need to run the following code below to install all the fonts on your computer (if desired) and the one you just downloaded/added. You will only need to import fonts only once on your machine. However, to use these fonts with any plotting in R, you will need to load the `extrafont` as with any other package.

    #load library (install if these are not already installed)
    library(extrafont)  #install.packages("extrafont")
    library(remotes)  #install.packages("remotes")

    #downgrade a package dependency for extrafont

    install_version("Rttf2pt1", version = "1.3.8")

    #import all Windows fonts
      font_import()
      
    #restart your R session - CTRL + SHIFT + F10

    #check that your fonts are now accessible in R
    library(extrafont)
    fonts()
