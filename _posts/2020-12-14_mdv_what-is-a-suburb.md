Last month, during the #30DayMapChallenge, there was a lot of great content created where folks in the data viz space visualized anything and everything that could be mapped. I'm a big fan of the content and style of [Katie Jolly's](https://www.katiejolly.io/portfolio/) work in general and a couple of her maps really stuck with me, especially the one below, ["Okay, but, what is a suburb?"](https://twitter.com/katiejolly6/status/1329961209861443587?s=20).

There are a number of things I really enjoy about Jolly's map that I want to highlight. But before we get into that, I wanted to talk a bit first about her [retrospective post](https://www.katiejolly.io/blog///2020-12-07/30-day-maps) on the design process. First off, I wanted to call out the brainstorming Jolly went through to create a purpose and work to find the data she needed. And secondly, the questions she hones in on the key data viz questions and clearly articulates each answer which is a practice we should all endeavor to follow. Those key questions are -  "**who is your audience?, how is your audience viewing your work?, and what do you want them to learn from it?**". If you have some time, I would check out the R code she uses and breaks down in her post.

Okay, now let's dive into the visual.

The annotations are particularly well done and are woven into the map. The annotations (one for each category) provide additional interesting content not captured in the title/subtitle and work better than having a paragraph of text off to the side.

The legend works really well too. The point of the visualization is that these categories aren't clearly defined (the data is sourced from [HUD's AHS](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/AHS-neighborhood-description-study-2017.html#overview-tab), asking respondents how they classified their neighborhood). Rather than just using one color for urban, suburban, or rural, she shows the degree of the major classification through shading, but makes it easy on the reader to take away rather than having a dense color ramp for each category.

The legend is integrated into the annotations as well!

Good use of call out boxes and space. She zooms into densely populated areas - northern VA, Roanoke and Richmond - to show how the classifications change over space. And those call out boxes are positioned in the natural negative space in the NW quadrant.

And then lastly, the font is well thought out (and not just a default), which helps draw in the reader's attention and makes the visual a bit playful.
