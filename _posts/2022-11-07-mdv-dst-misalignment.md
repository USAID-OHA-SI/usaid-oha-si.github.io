Hopefully everyone remembered to turn their clocks back yesterday (though, this is getting harder and harder not to do when most of our clocks are tied to our phones or are "smart" and associated with a calendar and automatically fall back) and enjoyed an extra hour sleeping in. If you recall, the Senate passed a bill in the spring that would eliminate daylight savings/switching our clocks twice a year in favor of keeping daylight savings permanent. 

Aaron Steckelberg and Lindsey Bever at the Post had a [great article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/permanent-standard-time-body-health-benefits/?wpisrc=nl_most&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F38436d7%2F63629000f3d9003c582244be%2F596c3eeb9bbc0f208656ffe8%2F8%2F72%2F63629000f3d9003c582244be&wp_cu=f89ffc650f6cd4fc539a3ea863db94dd%7CFDDC01D9FDC42CB0E040007F01001D98) last week talking about some of the detrimental effects to our health as it could "chronically throw our bodies out of sync with the sun and lead to a variety of health problems".  They produced a dynamic article with lots of great visuals. I particularly liked the ones below visualizing (and giving the perception of) the misalignment of your body's clock to what is happening on the solar clock.

Happy plotting!
