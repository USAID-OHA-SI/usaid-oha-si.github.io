This year's Olympics in Tokyo is feeling a bit different with the empty stadiums due to COVID. That said, it's still bringing me much joy to watch any sport at any time that I can imagine with +300 events across 41 different sports and athletes that have become household names - Ledecky, Biles, Rapinoe and more! And of course, there's always the great visualizations to track all the events and medals. I wanted to share a few articles/visuals that made me smile and brought me some inspiration.
