Data viz isn't something learned in a vacuum or isn't picked up by purely reading a book about it; it takes a lot of practice and learning from others as well. This month is an excellent opportunity to do both of these things with the [#30DayChartChallenge](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2330DayChartChallenge&src=hashtag_click).

Each day has a different visualization topic, which is a great way to get you out of your comfort zone and test out new techniques or think about things typically outside your wheelhouse.  There are also a lot of people posting their own visualizations under this [hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2330DayChartChallenge&src=hashtag_click) to follow and be inspired by.

Here's a few examples from the last few days that might inspire you.
