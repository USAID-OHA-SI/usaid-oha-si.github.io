Data viz is it's own particular arena, but there is lots to borrow for the design world ([I've touched on this before](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/data%20viz/2021/04/19/mdv-borrowing-from-design)). I came across this older post by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger [covering a few UI tips](https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886) that I found pretty useful. Here's a few I found particularly interesting.

- Use color and weight to create hierarchy instead of size

- Use fewer borders

- Donâ€™t blow up icons that are meant to be small

Check out the rest of Wathan and Schoger's design cheats for more details on the WHY for all of these as well as other ideas and see what you can apply to your own work.

Happy plotting!
