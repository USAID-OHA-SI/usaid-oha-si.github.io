The other week I discussed [the importance of iteration](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/data%20viz/2022/01/10/mdv-iterate.html) and my process from getting from start to finish. Apropos of this, Dylan Moriarty of the Washington Post graphics team [posted](https://twitter.com/dylanmoriarty/status/1482763932565655552?s=12) about the behind the scenes for his and Joe Fox's project on [redistricting mini golf](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/redistricting-mini-golf/).

The interactive (visual?) experience is far from your run of the mill plots and really gets you, the reader, involved for the ride. You play mini-golf as you learn about redistricting and gerrymandering - what could be more fun!?

Moriarty discusses the process, starting with the sketches, testing out different mediums, and eventually getting to the multilayered steps to get to a final product.

The game itself is amazing, but being able to read about what went into designing this is pretty inspiring. Hope you take some time to both read through the [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/dylanmoriarty/status/1482763932565655552?s=12) and play through the 9 hole mini golf course.

Happy plotting!
