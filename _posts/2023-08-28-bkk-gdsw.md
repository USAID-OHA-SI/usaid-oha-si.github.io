## Overview
From August 28-September 1, 2023, our division put on the USAID Global Data Skills Workshop in Bangkok, Thailand. For two and a half days, participants broke out into three different tracks by software preference (Excel, Tableau, R).

Goals - Understand how to optimize data lifecycles and workflows, build data skills in data visualization and statistical softwares and facilitate the sharing of critical data insights and solutions by Mission-based colleagues. 

Objectives - Learn how to execute related and scalable functions in one of 3 tracks focused on Excel, Tableau or R/RStudio and principles on the following topics: 

   1. Data collection, pipelines, processing, and management; examples include working with imperfect data by learning how to profile and clean your data, and transforming a raw dataset into tidy data;
   2. Data Visualization/Summaries, such as understanding the basic concepts of a plot and how to select the right visualization for a given analysis, learning how to layer information from multi-dimensional data to build upon the plot/s, and applying the OHA Style Guide to develop impactful visualizations; 
   3. Data Storytelling for data-driven, purposeful deliverables that translate into action.
