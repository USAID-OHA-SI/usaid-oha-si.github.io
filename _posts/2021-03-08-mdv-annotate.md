As I got started with data viz, I thought the secret to going from a standard graphic to a stellar one was all software based; what cutting edge software is going to allow me to show things with my data that allows me to show data in innovative ways to make my point. But over time, I've found that the key to creating informative graphics is right in front of all of us - our keyboards. Adding context to our plots amplies not just a narrative, but drives home the message we want our audience to come away with and provides key context. 

On an [older blog post on her Storytelling With Data blog](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2015/02/annotate-with-text), Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic makes these important points

> Don't assume that two different people looking at the same data visualization will walk away with the same conclusion. Which means, if there is a conclusion you want your audience to reach, you should state it in words. Use what we know about preattentive attributes to make those words stand out: make them big, leverage color and/or bold, and put them in high priority places on the page like the top.
