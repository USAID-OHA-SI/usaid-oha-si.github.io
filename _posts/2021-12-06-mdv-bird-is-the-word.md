I've been playing quite a bit of [Wingspan, the board game](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/science/wingspan-board-game-elizabeth-hargrave.html), so when I saw [Andrew Van Dam and Alyssa Fowers' article in the Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/28/bird-feeder-pecking-order/) last Sunday, I was super excited about the intersection of data, viz, and birds :) 

The article itself was pretty fascinating on pecking order of different bird species using a massive ornithologist database from [Project FeederWatch](https://feederwatch.org/) on bird interactions. But even better is the awesome graphics that accompany this article, which has great data encodings, great integration with actual bird vector art, annotations, and an active title. I think this is so great.

Happy plotting!
