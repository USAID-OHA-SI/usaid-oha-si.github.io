I came across a post from a year ago on Alli Torban's blog, Data Viz Today, which had an [interesting idea](https://dataviztoday.com/blog/30). In her post she says,

> There are so many decisions to make in the design process, and many times we aren’t even aware that we’re making a decision, like leaving default colors or not aligning text elements.
>
> **Open your eyes to those decisions and take notice of what professionals are doing by physically marking those decisions on the charts and maps.**
>
> So when I’m done reading the paper and enjoying all the graphics, I’ve started to take a red sharpie and circle important elements (title, subtitle, legend, labels) and specific design choices (bolding certain text, coloring/outlining certain elements, etc).

I really like this idea of not just passively taking in the graphics we are confronted with, but actively identifying key decisions the data viz designer/analyst is making. I gave this a try with last week's newspaper in a [viz comparing quarterbacks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/01/23/when-goats-meet-tom-brady-aaron-rodgers-by-numbers/?arc404=true), namely Tom Brady and Aaron Rogers.

While I can't do this with every visualization I come across, I do think it's a good exercise to conduct every now and again, helping bring all the components that go into viz to the forefront.
