            <h5>STYLE GUIDE</h5>
            <p>Welcome to the OHA SIEI data visualization style guide.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this product is to provide SIEI a set of guide rails on how to present data in-line with an overall vision so that all SIEI data visualizations have a common look and feel. SIEI produced visualizations do not need to all be identical, but they should appear as if they belong to the same family. This common appearance is achieved through the use of a set of elements belonging to an organization’s graphical style. For example, by using the same font, font size, color schemes, graphical elements, annotation patterns, and placement options, different users can create graphics grounded in a base style, while still allowing for creative flexibility. Think of organizations like FiveThirtyEight, Financial Times or BBC which have such distinctive styles that even on their own in the wild, you can clearly identify their origin.</p>
            <p>Creating a consistent look and feel for graphics has at least three organizational benefits. First, product creators can spend more time focusing on graphical content and messaging as the style elements are pre-defined for them. Secondly, a regular consumer of SIEI’s analytic products will be able to more easily read and interpret the graphical content based on familiarity of its preset guidelines. Finally, product consumers will come to recognize SIEI graphical products based on their style and may place more trustworthiness in them due to their familiarity with the product. At the end of the day, we want to create and disseminate visualizations that are consistent, trustworthy and easily identifiable as belonging to SIEI.</p>

            <h5>WHY A STYLE GUIDE</h5>
            <p>The motivation for creating this style guide comes from an SI assessment of Q1 Review presentation. The study documented over 150 different colors that were used for encoding data or annotations in visualizations contained in the Q1 Review.</p>
            <p>This not only results in a set of graphics that lack a standard look and forces a user to reorient themselves each time, it also creates a brand that is unmemorable/ unrecognizable and potentially not as trusted as a more polished product.</p>
            <p>This style guide serves as a tool to define and enhance brand cohesion. It is designed to save you and your SIEI colleagues time in the long run by reducing the number of decisions you have to make about chart size, graphical elements, which font, font sizes etc. This style guide is meant to provide clear recommendations on nearly every aspect of data visualizations. The guide can also help improve your data visualization skills as the recommendations contained within are built on the foundation of tested visualization principles. Lastly, a cohesive look for all our charts will improve our professionalism and help communicate messages to stakeholders more effectively.</p>

            <h5>HOW TO USE</h5>
            <p>This guide should not be viewed as a software specific tool that will tell you how to create visualizations, but rather a tool that lays out the foundational elements of the OHA brand. There are definitely things that you should and should not do when creating a visualization. But, because of the diversity of visualization tools used across the office there is no one size fits all solution to data visualization creation. Instead, this document is simply a guide complete with suggestions that are to be emulated. The chart types presented herein are not meant to be exhaustive. They are there to illustrate a stylistic approach that is consistent, identifiable and built on industry best practices. A situation may call for the use of a bee-swarm diagram or bump chart. Our hope is that this guide provides you the stylistic rationale that is to be applied to these types of visualizations and beyond.</p>

                            <h6>Title</h6>
                            <p>Convey the takeaway message you want the audience to come away with.
                                Should be written in all upper case letters.</p>

                            <h6>Subtitle</h6>
                            <p>Provides additional contextual information not covered in the title.
                                Smaller in size, not bolded or italicized, and may be a lighter color than the title.</p>

                            <h6>Axes/Grid</h6>
                            <p>Thin and dark in appearance so as not to detract attention from the information in the visual.
                                Text should always, always, always be horizontal as opposed to vertical or at a 45 degree angle.
                                Values use a comma separator and limit the use of decimal places. If directly labeling all values
                                on the chart elements, you should not also include axis text.
                                Axis ticks detract more than they add to the visual and should be removed.
                                Labels should be used sparingly and should be added only when it’s unclear what the values are.</p>

                            <h6>Annotation</h6>
                            <p>Provides contextual information beyond the values stored in the graph.
                                Draws the reader’s eye to important information, such as highlighting outliers,
                                important countries/partners, and helps tell a story about the data.
                                Annotations include direct labels of data elements and longer comments about the context or data.
                                Annotations should be used sparingly; rather than directly labeling every point or column,
                                they should only highlight the important elements of the visual.
                                Text should be thin and light to not overpower or detract from the data in the visual.

                            <h6>Caption</h6>
                            <p>Footer text containing the data source and notes or caveats about the data,
                                providing information critical for integrity and transparency.
                                Located in the lower right hand corner of the visual and be a light shade of gray.</p>

                            <h6>Legend</h6>
                            Mapping between colors/sizes and values used in a graph.
                            Where possible, incorporate into direct labeling or graph title/subtitle.</p>
