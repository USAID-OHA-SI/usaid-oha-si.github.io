## Welcome to Global Health / OHA Github Site

You can access the live site at [USAID-OHA-SI](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Maintenance

This repo is used to maintain USAID-OHA-SI's website. All pages should be updated and publish through this repo.

### Setting up Jekyll on your local host

GitHub uses Jekyll, a Ruby Gem, to update the website on _github.io_

For you to preview and test the site locally before pushing your updated code, you will need to install Jekyll.

Follow these [instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll and all the related requirements.

### Publishing a tutorial or blog post

1. File type

Markdown files (.md) are recommended 

2. File name

You post will need to names as follow: YYYY-MM-DD-Sample-Post-Title-Here.md
Dashes are used as space markers, so "Sample-Post-Title-Here" will end up as "Sample Post Title Here"
Here is an example:
`2020-04-20-Processing-HFR-Country-Data-with-Wavelenth-R.md`

3. File content

    The header should be always wraped within a pair of 3 dashes and contain a _layout_, _title_, _date_ (in YYYY-MM-DD format), and _author_.
    One could also include _categories_ in the header to group posts by category. You may use more that one categories. Tags are also allowed.

    categories: [Tutorial, HFR, Reporting]
