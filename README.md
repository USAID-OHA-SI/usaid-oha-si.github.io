## Welcome to Global Health / OHA Github Site

You can view the live site at [USAID-OHA-SI](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Maintenance

The site is built with Jekyll Templating so all pages could be updated and publish through this repo.

Quick Markdown references are below:

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/usaid-oha-si.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
